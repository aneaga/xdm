A metric is a definition of a measurable or countable quantity. 

A metric consists of a measurement and a dimension. 
For easier identification, metrics have a name and a unique URI that can be used when referring to the metric.

Through XDM's extensibility mechanism, new metrics can be defined by extending `Metric`.
